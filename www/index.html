The JavaHelp system is an online help system that developers can use
to add online help to their Java platform applications. The JavaHelp
system is both a JCP specification (<A
HREF="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=97">JSR 97</A>) and a
reference implementation of that specification. The JavaHelp system
open source project includes the source to the reference implementation.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<p>
The JavaHelp system provides developers and authors with a standard,
fully featured, easy to use system for presenting online information
to Java application users.  The JavaHelp system is a
Java Platform, Standard Edition ("Java SE") optional package.
</p>
<p>
The JavaHelp system consists of a fully featured, extensible
specification and API, and a reference implementation of that
specification and API that is written entirely in the Java programming language.
The JavaHelp system reference implementation, based on the Java Foundation
Classes (JFC, also known as Swing), provides a standard interface that
enables both application developers and authors to add online help to
their applications.
</p>
<p>
The specification and API enable developers to customize and extend the help system to fit the style
and requirements of their applications.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the JavaHelp system has been designed to work especially well in a variety of network
environments. The JavaHelp system is platform independent and works in all browsers that support the Java
platform.
</p>
<p>
The JavaHelp system enables Java developers to provide online help for:
<ul>
<li>Applications (both applet and standalone)
<li>JavaBeansTM components
<li>Applets in HTML pages
<li>Server-based Java applications 
</ul>

<p>
The <A HREF="PDF/jhug.pdf">JavaHelp System User's Guide</A> describes the help system and includes
the following sections:
<ul>
<li>A description of the contents of the current JavaHelp system release.
<li>A general overview of the JavaHelp system. Describes features, usage scenarios, and other technical details.
<li>A guide for help authors. Describes how to: set up a help system, use popups and secondary windows, use
context-sensitive help, use full-text search, and package help information for delivery to users.
<li>A guide for developers. Describes how to: add JavaHelp to applications, implement context?sensitive help,
embed JavaHelp components into applications, and develop lightweight Java components that can be added
to help topics.
<li>A guide for localizers of JavaHelp systems.
</ul>

<h3>The JavaHelp Version 2.0 Technical Compatibility Kit (TCK)</h3>
<!--END SECTION HEADER *  THIS IS A GREEN BAR WITH WHITE TEXT   -->
<p>
Because the JavaHelp system is a Java SE platform optional package,
any implementation of the specification must pass the TCK in order
to verify its compatibility with the JSR 97 specification.
</p>
<p>
The TCK is packaged as a Zip archive. After you download and unpack the Zip
archive, you must edit and modify the five properties at the top of the
file <code>run-test.xml</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that execution of the compatibility kit requires Ant. Ant is available at
<A href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/ </A>.
<p>
To run the tests execute the following command:
<p><code><b>ant -f run-test.xml</b></code>
